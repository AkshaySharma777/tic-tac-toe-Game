        <h1> When playing Tic-Tac-Toe, there are several simple and easy-to-follow rules that you should observe.
            The rules that you need to be aware of include the following:</h1>

        <li> The traditional version of Tic-Tac-Toe must be played on a 3Ã—3 grid that incorporates 9 squares. </li>
        <li> Players must select their mark before the game starts (either X or O) and must play the entire game
            using the same mark.</li>
        <li> Players must take turns, making only 1 mark with each turn.</li>
        <li> Marks can only be placed in empty squares, and once it is placed, it is permanent.</li>
        <li> The winner is the first player to get 3 of their marks in a straight line (the line can be positioned
            diagonally, vertically, or horizontally).</li>
        <li> The game is over when all 9 squares are filled with marks, even if none of the players have a straight
            line of 3 marks.
        <li> If neither player has a straight line of 3 marks, it is considered a tie.</li>
